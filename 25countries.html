				<dl>Kabul: Kabul is exciting, frustrating, inspiring and shocking in equal measure. Once a stop on the hippy trail, and then ruined by civil war, Kabul's path to reconstruction remains rocky. In recent years it has boomed with new buildings, fancy restaurants and busy bazaars.</dl>
				<dl>Bamiya:Once a place of Buddhist pilgrimage, Bamiyan is now more closely associated with the destruction visited on Afghanistan's culture. The two giant statutes of the Buddha that once dominated the valley lie in rubble, victims of the Taliban's iconoclastic rage. Yet the Bamiyan Valley remains one of the most beautiful places in Afghanistan, and a must-see for any visitor.</dl>
				<dl>Mazar-e Sharif: North Afghanistan's biggest city, Mazar-e Sharif was long overshadowed by the power of its neighbour Balkh. It took a 12th-century mullah to change that. He claimed to have found the hidden tomb of Ali, the Prophet Mohammed's son-in-law, buried in a local village. Its shrine today is the focus of the national Nawroz (Narvus) celebrations.</dl>
