            <p>Students may use My Grades to check their grades. On the My Grades page, students can choose to view All, Graded, Upcoming or Submitted assignments.</p>
            <p>The first two grades on the page (while in the All category) are the Weighted Total and the Total amount of points you’ve earned in the class. The Weighted </p>
            <p>Total is sometimes only available once all assignments have been graded and assigned a “weight." The weight of a grade varies depending on how</p>
            <p> important the assignment is compared to other assignments. For example, a daily grade typically weighs less than a test grade. If assignments are graded on</p>
            <p> the same point scale for each assignment but the weights differ, the Total Points score may be misleading.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Below the two totals, there is a list of all the assignments that have been given throughout the semester. The list starts with the first grade taken in the class and ends</p>
            <p> with the most recent. Teachers often leave comments when they put your grade in Blackboard. These comments are useful because they inform you of what you did right or</p>
            <p> wrong in the assignment which teaches you what to do in future assignments to sustain or  improve your grade.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Clicking the Graded button will show you a list of only assignments that have already been graded. If you want to check to see when an assignment is due, you can click</p>
            <p> the Upcoming button at the top of the page. If you’re unsure if you turned in an assignment because you haven’t received a grade for it yet, you can click the Submitted button</p>
            <p> to see a list of assignments that have been turned in but not graded.</p>
