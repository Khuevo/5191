        <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">The University of North Texas provides students with access to Blackboard. Blackboard is an e-learning software that allows instructors to publish</p>
        <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"> content, communicate with students, and perform other actions to manage their courses. </p>
        <p>Students may access Blackboard to view important course information like content, grades, messages, and due dates for assignments.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Many classes place content on the Blackboard; however, the amount of content will vary by professor. Some courses rely heavily on the site, using</p>
        <p> it to administer quizzes and tests, facilitate class discussions, communicate important announcements, and provide feedback on graded assignments.</p>
        <p> Many online courses are also conducted primarily through this program. </p>
