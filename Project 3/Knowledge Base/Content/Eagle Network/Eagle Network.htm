        <p>Eagle Network is a referral service offered to students and employers at the University of North Texas (UNT).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: #2e8b57; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Students</span>
        </p>
        <p> Students may access the latest  information  about available opportunities for on- and off-campus jobs and internships. Students may also sign up for</p>
        <p> interviews they think they are qualified for. Students can also sign up for events and workshops held by Career Center at UNT using this service.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: #2e8b57; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Employers</span>
        </p>
        <p>Eagle Network offers employers the opportunities to create job postings and register for events. On- and off-campus recruiters may post job </p>
        <p>advertisements, but they must comply with the University of North Texas Nondiscrimination/Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action </p>
        <p>Policy (1.3.7) and the university’s additional Recruiting Policies and Guidelines. Employers can also sign up for events like job fairs, where they have</p>
        <p> the chance to meet students on campus to find the best matches for the company.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: #2e8b57; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;">Accessing Eagle Network</span>
        </p>
        <p>To access this service, students must sign in to the page using their Enterprise-Wide User-ID (EUID, which is tied to each UNT student, and they can</p>
        <p> choose to access the service via MyUNT or log in directly to the page. However, they must use a different password for their EUID if students choose</p>
        <p> to log in directly to Eagle Network. Eagle Network requires a separate password with MyUNT, Blackboard, and EagleConnect.</p>
