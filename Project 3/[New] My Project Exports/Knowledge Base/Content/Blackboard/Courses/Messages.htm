        <p>The Messages menu is used to send messages to other students or to your professor. Messages send in Blackboard are only viewable to others when </p>
        <p>they are using Blackboard (the mail is not tied in with your EagleConnect). The Blackboard website describes this service by stating, “Course Messages</p>
        <p> are private and secure text-based communication that occurs within a course and among course members. Although similar to email, users must be</p>
        <p> logged into the course to read and send messages.”</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>By default there are two folders on the Messages page, Inbox and Sent. </p>
