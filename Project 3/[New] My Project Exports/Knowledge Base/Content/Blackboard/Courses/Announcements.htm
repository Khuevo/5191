        <p>When you select a course on the My Institution page, you will automatically be taken to the Announcements section for that course. You can</p>
        <p>return to this page by either clicking the Announcements option in the Course Menu or by clicking Home icon next to the course title </p>
        <p>(also in the Course Menu)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Announcements are listed in reverse chronological order. The Announcements page is important to check regularly because instructors will</p>
        <p> often announce important information pertaining to the course. Instructors may post important links, assignment reminders, extra credit opportunities.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The below image shows an example of announcements for a course. </p>
