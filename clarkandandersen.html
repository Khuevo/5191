	<p>In the paper “Renegotiating with Technology: Training Towards More Sustainable Technical Communication”, Dave Clark and Rebekka Andersen discussed about the function of technologies in the field of technical communication as “tools” and argued for the training that would extend technical communicators’ possibilities when working and researching in organizations so that technical communicators would make technical communication more sustainable.</p>
	<p>Talking about technologies, first they mentioned about the limited perception that outsiders have on technical communicators’ technological work that ultimately made them underestimate technical communicators’ contributions to organizations. On top of that, technical communicators were urged to embrace and apply knowledge management concepts, but examples have shown a post-2000 decline in the reflection on knowledge management but a bigger focus on tool related discussions of content management, XML, and single sourcing. It shows that technical communication tends to focus on the tools themselves not the business and management types. Technical communicators thought of XML as a way to bring about not just data, but data along with context, which simply supported knowledge management. “Technology as tool” was also explained as a “practical, design-oriented viewpoint in which users think of themselves as in control of technologies that they apply to practical ends such as the rhetorical design of products”. But for technical communicators wishing to raise their organizational status, technologies must not only be seen as tools but as part of larger organizational strategies.</p>
	<p>. So in order for technical communicators to sustain and grow, the authors mentioned about training approaches that could potentially trigger a re-consideration of technical communication’s relationship with technology: train for design credibility and train for organizational credibility. For each of the training approaches, the authors supplied specific objects for both practitioners and academics. In details, practitioners must avoid vendor-driven software tutorials, better articulate the contributions of their design efforts to product success and failure, involve themselves in information technology discussions and journals and be more proactive. Academics are responsible for focusing on organizational problems as projects, focusing on organizational audiences and adopting technical program models. To train for organizational credibility, practitioners must be trained to be business advocates by understanding their organization’s “financial model, management structure and approach, values and strategy, integrating business technology training in their business practices, changing their conception of the goals of STC and similar venues, and focusing less on case studies about tool use success and “how to” workshops, plus focusing more on topics that will help technical communicators better understand business perspective on technology development; and they also need to have training on being business-minded mentors. Academics do not only develop a new approach to technology development training, but also develop interdependent courses and build relationships with other programs. Last but not least, they could also influence training through better research dissemination. All these training approaches are for helping technical communicators breaking out of the conviction that to be a technical communicator was about knowing all the tools. The training could create solutions for the relationship between technical communicators and technology.</p>
