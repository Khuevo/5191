Project 4 status

300-word status update on Project 4. List what deliverables you've completed and what deliverables you still have to complete. Include specific dates for each deliverable.

 

I have been working on my project 4 after receiving the approval from Dr. Lam for the topic I chose. There will be total three deliverables from my project, and I have been working on my first one: Project about Fuschia’s online marketing for marketing peers within the firm. The other two include one document for investors to raise capital, and one is a report of the principles/used in the project. I plan to have my first deliverable finished on November 20th, then I will have my second deliverable (the investors’ document) done on November 27th, and the last report will be ready on December 1st.

During the time, I plan to communicate with Dr. Lam for further advice, my Marketing classmates who may have any suggestion on my work. I have also read my Marketing books, followed Marketing journals, magazines and online articles to get exposed to more Marketing knowledge, concepts, and practical examples.

After finishing all the content, I will put them in html format in order to practice myself more with the tools. I do not want to forget what I leant about htlm from class and Project 2 after finishing it.

That is the plan I have been committed to. However, I am also open to other new ideas may come about to polish my project best along the time. I expect to finish the project on time, and gained a lot of new experience from it.
