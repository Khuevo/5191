		<p>XSLT can be defined in multiples ways using multiples terms depending on different people, or websites. However, all those definitions have some important points in common: XSLT stands for XSL Transformations, and its job is to transform the XML (Extensible Markup Language) data into other forms without the need for program in JavaTM or other languages.  According to Peter K. Jackson in his video posted on YouTube, the process of transformation start off with XML Data, then we take the XSLT statements, which is basically a programming language, to mix it with a little of HTML and CSS, next we fit it in a parser, which can be Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Saxon. That way, the parser will combine the SXLT statements with the XML data and come out as a new output. The output can be a XHTML file, a PDF file, a ZIP file, even a plain text file, or users can completely reformat the XML with the XSLT statements and come up with a different structure or format for an XML document.</p>
		<p>SXLT is the most important part of XSL. With SXLT, users can add or remove elements and attributes to or from the output fie. Users can also rearrange and sort element, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a lot more. In short, XSLT transforms an XML source-tree into an XML result-tree.</p>
		<p>As for technical communicators (TCs), XSLT is useful and essential in various ways. First, as stated, XSLT allows users to create multiples different types of output from one source. This saves TCs a huge amount of time editing and modifying their products whenever needed. Once a change is committed to the source, change is applied to all the documents rooted with that source. The number of “indirectly edited” documents can range from 10 to 100. Therefore, XSLT plays a very important role in TCs’ works in terms of single sourcing. Besides, XSLT, as being compatible with other tools, makes XML versatile. Jobs’ nature requires TCs to create multiple documents in distinct formats, and in some cases, XML does not supply or support certain actions. However, thanks to XSLT, TCs can incorporate diverse documents with XML data to produce the final output. Many other advantages can be pointed out, but the ones discussed are undeniably useful for all people working as TCs.</p>
