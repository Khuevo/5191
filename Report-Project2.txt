Report of My XML Database Project
First and foremost, I want to mention my .xml file. It consists of 25 entries about 25 countries to travel to. Most of the information was collected from the book Lonely Planet: The World. I have been actively updating the data in the file. However, since the amount of data was high, and I have to do the typing work all the time, it takes a little longer than I expected. 
When I had around 10 entries in my.xml file, I started working on linking it to a .xsl file. It did not work at first but thanks to instruction from Dr. Lam, I finally succeeded in the job. After that, I spent them formatting the table in .xsl and at the moment, I have finished making lists inside a row in the table. I have been trying to make two columns in the table sortable, but haven’t found the exact way yet. Besides, which is fortunate for me, Dr. Lam reminded us to transfer the .xml data to .xsl when we have a small number of entries, and I did so. It turned out that I realized there were some parts of the data should be added or omitted, and at the moment, I feel pretty good with the structure of data that I have. 
I have spent this weekend to work on .xsl file as well as reviewing some .css practices that I know. I know that the due day is coming really soon, so I do hope that I can create the most satisfying product on time. So far, the project is really valuable and I am happy I learned extremely knowledge from it. (Since my data is about travelling, I even feel that I want to stand up, take my backpack, my passport and travel right away sometimes. I hope that readers can feel the same when reading mine.)
